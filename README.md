3. US customers provide ratings more frequently and consistently than Indians.

4. Popular Indian cuisine is North Indian owing to 4 major North Indian cities and for the USA it’s all-American food.

5. India and US have moderate food prices as compared to the rest of the countries.

6. Better affordability has led to restaurants offering in price range 1 but this could affect Zomato’s unit economics. The average price range 1 is Rs 284, except this, all the rest price ranges provide positive returns based on previous analysis on unit economics.

7. Provide reservations and online delivery to receive valuable customer feedback and rating.

8. Positive relation exists between ratings and the average cost for two, this could be because of the assumed notion that premium restaurants have good ambiance or better service, whereas regular restaurants cannot provide such an experience which could lead to lower ratings.
